# Java Streams
Change the implementations of the methods found in [the analyser class](./src/main/java/DataAnalyser.java) so the code
is no longer procedural, and resembles a more functional syntax.

To do this, [Java Streams](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html) can be very
useful here.

Remember to refactor the code so the [tests](./src/test/java/DataAnalyserShould.java) always stay green.
